The model is calibrated to match separation, job finding, and employment in the {SIPP} data. The model predicts a big drop in employment for workers with weak comparative advantage during recessions. But the data show that workers with strong comparative advantage also display sizable employment fluctuations, implying that aggregate employment fluctuations are not explained by the responses of workers with small rents to employment.},

	abstract = {Periods of rapid U.S. economic growth during the 1960s and 1970s coincided with improved living standards for many segments of the population, including the disadvantaged as well as the affluent, suggesting to some that a rising economic tide lifts all demographic boats. This paper investigates the impact of U.S. business cycle conditions on population well-being since the 1970s. Aggregate employment and hours worked in this period are strongly procyclical, particularly for low-skilled workers, while aggregate real wages are only mildly procyclical. Similar patterns appear in a balanced panel of {PSID} respondents that removes the effects of changing workforce composition, though the magnitude of the responsiveness of real wages to unemployment appears to have declined in the last 20 years. Economic upturns increase the likelihood that workers acquire jobs in sectors with positively sloped career ladders. Spending by state and local governments in all categories rises during economic expansions, including welfare spending, for which needs vary countercyclically. Since the disadvantaged are likely to benefit disproportionately from such government spending, it follows that the public finances also contribute to conveying the benefits of a strong economy to diverse population groups.},

It establishes an appropriate attribute subset size and then randomly selects subsets of features, creating projections of the training set on which the ensemble classifiers are built. The induced classifiers are then used for voting. This article compares the performance of our {AB} method with bagging and other algorithms on a hand-pose recognition dataset. It is shown that {AB} gives consistently better results than bagging, both in accuracy and stability. The performance of ensemble voting in bagging and the {AB} method as a function of the attribute subset size and the number of voters for both weighted and unweighted voting is tested and discussed. We also demonstrate that ranking the attribute subsets by their classification accuracy and voting using only the best subsets further improves the resulting performance of the ensemble.},

These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy, (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit. I argue that recognizing the distinct forms of opacity that may be coming into play in a given application is a key to determining which of a variety of technical and non-technical solutions could help to prevent harm.},

The present study compares the predictive accuracy of several machine learning methods including Logistic Regression ({LR}), Classification and Regression Trees ({CART}), Bayesian Additive Regression Trees ({BART}), Support Vector Machines ({SVM}), Random Forests ({RF}), and Neural Networks ({NNet}) for predicting phishing emails. A data set of 2889 phishing and legitimate emails is used in the comparative study. In addition, 43 features are used to train and test the classifiers.},

Content-based recommendation systems may be used in a variety of domains ranging from recommending web pages, news articles, restaurants, television programs, and items for sale. Although the details of various systems differ, content-based recommendation systems share in common a means for describing the items that may be recommended, a means for creating a profile of the user that describes the types of items the user likes, and a means of comparing items to the user profile to determine what to re commend. The profile is often created and updated automatically in response to feedback on the desirability of items that have been presented to the user.},

	abstract = {The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement ({CETA}) is a free-trade agreement between Canada, the European Union and its member states. If it enters into force, the treaty will eliminate 98\% of the tariffs between Canada and the {EU}.
The negotiations were concluded in August 2014. All 28 European Union member states approved the final text of {CETA} for signature, with Belgium being the final country to give its approval. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, traveled to Brussels on 30 October 2016 to sign on behalf of Canada. The European Parliament approved the deal on 15 February 2017. The agreement is subject to ratification by the {EU} and national legislatures and can only enter into force if no adverse opinion is given by the European Court of Justice following a request for an opinion by Belgium. Until its formal entry into force, substantial parts are provisionally applied from 21 September 2017.
The European Commission indicates the treaty will lead to savings of just over half a billion euros in taxes for {EU} exporters every year, mutual recognition in regulated professions such as architects, accountants and engineers, and easier transfers of company staff and other professionals between the {EU} and Canada. The European Commission claims {CETA} will create a more level playing field between Canada and the {EU} on intellectual property rights.
Proponents of {CETA} emphasize that the agreement will boost trade between the {EU} and Canada and thus create new jobs, facilitate business operations by abolishing customs duties, goods checks, and various other levies, facilitate mutual recognition of diplomas and regulate investment disputes by creating a new system of courts. Opponents consider that {CETA} would weaken European consumer rights, including high {EU} standards concerning food safety, and criticize it as a boon only for big business and multinational corporations, while risking net-losses, unemployment, and environmental damage impacting individual citizens. The deal also includes a controversial investor-state dispute settlement mechanism which makes critics fear that multinational corporations could sue national governments for billions of dollars if they thought that the government policies had a bad impact on their business. A poll conducted by Angus Reid Institute in February 2017 concluded that 55 percent of Canadians support {CETA}, while only 10 percent oppose it. The support, however, has waned when comparing to the poll conducted in 2014. In contrast, the North American Free Trade Agreement ({NAFTA}) has a 44 percent support rate among Canadians in February 2017. In contrast to Canada, the agreement has prompted protests in a number of European countries.},

Although this is inherently a model selection problem, a model selection perspective is rarely adopted for this task. We suggest that Cudeck and Henly's (1991) framework can be applied to guide the selection process. Researchers must first identify the analytic goal: identifying the (approximately) correct m or identifying the most replicable m. Second, researchers must choose fit indices that are most congruent with their goal. Consistent with theory, a simulation study showed that different fit indices are best suited to different goals. Moreover, model selection with one goal in mind (e.g., identifying the approximately correct m) will not necessarily lead to the same number of factors as model selection with the other goal in mind (e.g., identifying the most replicable m). We recommend that researchers more thoroughly consider what they mean by “the right number of factors” before they choose fit indices.},

	abstract = {An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives.“Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.”―Elon Musk, cochair of {OpenAI}; cofounder and {CEO} of Tesla and {SpaceXDeep} learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.},

	shorttitle = {Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control, Vol. {II}, 4th Edition},
	abstract = {This 4th edition is a major revision of Vol. {II} of the leading two-volume dynamic programming textbook by Bertsekas, and contains a substantial amount of new material, as well as a reorganization of old material. The length has increased by more than 60\% from the third edition, andmost of the old material has been restructured and/or revised. Volume {II} now numbers more than 700 pages and is larger in size than Vol. I. It can arguably be viewed as a new book! Approximate {DP} has become the central focal point of Vol. {II}, and occupies more than half of the book (the last two chapters, and large parts of Chapters 1-3). Thus one may also view Vol. {II} as a followup of the author's 1996 book ``Neuro-Dynamic Programming" (coauthored with John Tsitsiklis). The present book focuses to a great extenton new research that became available after 1996. On the other hand, the textbook style of the book has been preserved, and some material has been explained at an intuitive or informal level, while referring to the journal literature or the Neuro-Dynamic Programming book for a more mathematical treatment.As the book's focus shifted, increased emphasis was placed on new or recent research in approximate {DP} and simulation-based methods, as well as on asynchronous iterative methods, in view of the central role of simulation, which is by nature asynchronous. A lot of this material is an outgrowth of research conducted in the six years since the previous edition. Some of the highlights, in the order appearing in the book, are:(a) A broad spectrum of simulation-based, approximate value iteration, policy iteration, and Q-learning methods based on projected equations and aggregation.(b) New policy iteration and Q-learning algorithms for stochastic shortest path problems with improper policies. (c) Reliable Q-learning algorithms for optimistic policy iteration.(d) New simulation techniques for multistep methods, such as geometric and free-form sampling, based on generalized weighted Bellman equations. (e) Computational methods for generalized/abstract discounted {DP}, including convergence analysis and error bounds for approximations.(f) Monte Carlo linear algebra methods, which extend the approximate {DP} methodology to broadly applicable problems involving large-scale regression and systems of linear equations. The book includes a substantial number of examples, and exercises, detailed solutions of many of which are posted on the internet. It was developed through teaching graduate courses at M.I.T., and is supported by a large amount of educational material, such as slides and videos, posted at the {MIT} Open Courseware, the author's, and the publisher's web sites. Contents: 1. Discounted Problems - Theory. 2. Discounted Problems - Computational Methods. 3.Stochastic Shortest Path Problems. 4. Undiscounted Problems. 5. Average Cost per Stage Problems. 6.

It distinguishes part‐time and full‐time employment sectors, which differ by pecuniary and nonpecuniary returns and transferability of human capital. The model with unobserved heterogeneity in earning ability and preferences for children fits the data and produces reasonable forecasts of labor force participation in decisions. The estimates unpack important features of the persistence in labor market decisions, intertemporal substitution of leisure over the life cycle, and the effect of work interruptions, due to childbirth, on lifetime utility.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the life-cycle career costs associated with child rearing and decomposes their effects into unearned wages (as women drop out of the labor market), loss of human capital, and selection into more child-friendly occupations. We estimate a dynamic life-cycle model of fertility, occupational choice, and labor supply using detailed survey and administrative data for Germany for numerous birth cohorts across different regions. We use this model to analyze both the male-female wage gap as it evolves from labor market entry onward and the effect of pro-fertility policies. We show that a substantial portion of the gender wage gap is explainable by realized and expected fertility and that the long-run effect of policies encouraging fertility are considerably lower than the short-run effects typically estimated in the literature.},

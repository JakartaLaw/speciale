This paper investigates reinforcement learning as a solution method for dynamic models. A discrete time, finite horizon, discrete choice model of female labour supply and fertility is formulated, and the model is solved using value function iteration and two reinforcement learning methods, namely deep Q-learning and double deep Q-learning. After estimating the model using method of simulated moments, and finding the simple model inadequate to describe data from Statistic Denmark, the model is extended. The extension consists of 14 + 1 states. The extended model is solved only using double deep Q-learning and estimated using simulated method of moments. The results of the extended model convincingly matches data from Statistics Denmark and contemporary findings by \textcite{kleven_children_2019}. I conclude that the field of economics should further investigate reinforcement learning, as it allows solving dynamic models with high dimensional state space.

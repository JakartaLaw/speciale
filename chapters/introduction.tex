What is the effect of children on the labour supply? This paper tries to answer this question by presenting a dynamical structural model, where the utility trade off between consumption and leisure is affected by having children, assuming the causal relationship being:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Kids} \ra \text{Utility} \ra \text{Working hours}
\end{equation}

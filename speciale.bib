	abstract = {An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives.“Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.”―Elon Musk, cochair of {OpenAI}; cofounder and {CEO} of Tesla and {SpaceXDeep} learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.},

	isbn = {978-1-886529-44-1},
	shorttitle = {Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control, Vol. {II}, 4th Edition},
	abstract = {This 4th edition is a major revision of Vol. {II} of the leading two-volume dynamic programming textbook by Bertsekas, and contains a substantial amount of new material, as well as a reorganization of old material. The length has increased by more than 60\% from the third edition, andmost of the old material has been restructured and/or revised. Volume {II} now numbers more than 700 pages and is larger in size than Vol. I. It can arguably be viewed as a new book! Approximate {DP} has become the central focal point of Vol. {II}, and occupies more than half of the book (the last two chapters, and large parts of Chapters 1-3). Thus one may also view Vol. {II} as a followup of the author's 1996 book ``Neuro-Dynamic Programming" (coauthored with John Tsitsiklis). The present book focuses to a great extenton new research that became available after 1996. On the other hand, the textbook style of the book has been preserved, and some material has been explained at an intuitive or informal level, while referring to the journal literature or the Neuro-Dynamic Programming book for a more mathematical treatment.As the book's focus shifted, increased emphasis was placed on new or recent research in approximate {DP} and simulation-based methods, as well as on asynchronous iterative methods, in view of the central role of simulation, which is by nature asynchronous. A lot of this material is an outgrowth of research conducted in the six years since the previous edition. Some of the highlights, in the order appearing in the book, are:(a) A broad spectrum of simulation-based, approximate value iteration, policy iteration, and Q-learning methods based on projected equations and aggregation.(b) New policy iteration and Q-learning algorithms for stochastic shortest path problems with improper policies. (c) Reliable Q-learning algorithms for optimistic policy iteration.(d) New simulation techniques for multistep methods, such as geometric and free-form sampling, based on generalized weighted Bellman equations. (e) Computational methods for generalized/abstract discounted {DP}, including convergence analysis and error bounds for approximations.(f) Monte Carlo linear algebra methods, which extend the approximate {DP} methodology to broadly applicable problems involving large-scale regression and systems of linear equations. The book includes a substantial number of examples, and exercises, detailed solutions of many of which are posted on the internet. It was developed through teaching graduate courses at M.I.T., and is supported by a large amount of educational material, such as slides and videos, posted at the {MIT} Open Courseware, the author's, and the publisher's web sites.

It distinguishes part‐time and full‐time employment sectors, which differ by pecuniary and nonpecuniary returns and transferability of human capital. The model with unobserved heterogeneity in earning ability and preferences for children fits the data and produces reasonable forecasts of labor force participation in decisions. The estimates unpack important features of the persistence in labor market decisions, intertemporal substitution of leisure over the life cycle, and the effect of work interruptions, due to childbirth, on lifetime utility.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the life-cycle career costs associated with child rearing and decomposes their effects into unearned wages (as women drop out of the labor market), loss of human capital, and selection into more child-friendly occupations. We estimate a dynamic life-cycle model of fertility, occupational choice, and labor supply using detailed survey and administrative data for Germany for numerous birth cohorts across different regions. We use this model to analyze both the male-female wage gap as it evolves from labor market entry onward and the effect of pro-fertility policies. We show that a substantial portion of the gender wage gap is explainable by realized and expected fertility and that the long-run effect of policies encouraging fertility are considerably lower than the short-run effects typically estimated in the literature.},
